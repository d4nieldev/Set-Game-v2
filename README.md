# Introduction
In this project I implemented a simple version of the game "Set". 
<br />
A description of the original game can be found here: ![Set Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

# My Version of the Game
The game contains a deck of 81 cards. Each card contains a drawing with four features (color, number, shape, shading).
<br />
The game starts with 12 drawn cards from the deck that are placed on a 3x4 grid on the table.
<br />
The goal of each player is to find a combination of three cards from the cards on the table that are said to make up a *legal set*.
<br />
A *legal set* is defined as a set of 3 cards, that for each one of the four features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either: 
* all the same
or:
* all different 
<br />
In other words, for each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different
version.
